## About me
Hi! üëã Not sure what to say here, I like computer, some say I'm almost like a ü§ñ at times, so there's that.

I read, write and speak Englihs, Chinese and Japanese.


## Education background
- Tsinghua University (Ê∏ÖÂçéÂ§ßÂ≠¶) - school of software
-  +Self-taught in programming outside of uni


<!---I was a self-tuaght at basically everything from programming and adobe software suite until I had the mis-fortune of being enrolled in Tsinghua UniversityÔºàÊ∏ÖÂçéÂ§ßÂ≠¶Ôºâ, one of the most brutal, back-breaking educational institution that is the equivalent of MIT of China, I went through their software engineering program undergraduate that basically equates to "you now 'officially' know software engineering" despite the idiotic nature of tertiary education in this day and age, in which I learn basically nothing outside of what I already know through online resources.
**TL;DR, I'm a self-learner that has the standard quality control stamp of the top 10 university in the world.**
